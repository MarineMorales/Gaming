## List of my gaming programming projects

1. Guess the Number

The computer will think of a secret number from 1 to 20 and ask the user to guess it.  After each guess, the computer will tell the user whether the number is too high or too low. The user wins if they can guess the number within six tries.

## How to run the games in your Command Prompt

Input 1: C:\Users\Your_User_Name>cd C:\Users\Your_User_Name\Code_Folder_location

Input 2: C:\Users\Your_User_Name\Code_Folder_location>python Code_File.py 

For instance, if you want to run the python File named *GuessTheNumber.py* located in the folder named *PythonGameFolder* itself located on your desktop, you will need the follow the prompt below:

>C:\Users\MarineMorales>cd C:\Users\MarineMorales\OneDrive\Desktop\PythonGameFolder
